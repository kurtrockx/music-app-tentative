# 🎧 Spotify Explorer (React Router Demo)

This is a simple React app that integrates with the **Spotify Public API**. The main purpose of this project is to explore and demonstrate the use of **react-router-dom** for routing in a modern React application.

> ⚠️ Note: The features are **intentionally limited** due to the restrictions of the public API and the educational nature of this project.
